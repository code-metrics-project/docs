# Code Metrics

## About the project

At its core, Code Metrics provides a collection of whole project lifecycle code quality analysis tools. It enables you to combine sources to look for correlations, to answer questions over time such as:

- what is my bug to change ratio?
- which files are frequently implicated when bugs are fixed?
- how does test coverage correlate to escaped bugs?
- how has complexity changed with codebase size?
- how much churn has there been in the codebase (i.e. additions, edits, deletions)

...and many more custom combinations you create.
