# Workloads

## Overview

A workload represents one or more repositories, in one or more repository groups. With this concept, you can model a team, an application or a single component.

> **Note**
> See the [workload configuration](./config_workloads.md) section.

## Workload summary

Each workload has a summary page, showing recent trends.

It provides a view of:

- all bugs
- test coverage
- pipeline success rate
- [DORA metrics](./dora.md)

## Grouping workloads

Workloads can be grouped together. This is useful for viewing a summary of all workloads in a group. You group workloads using [tags](./tags.md).
