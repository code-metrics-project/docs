# Deployment overview

You can run Code Metrics in a number of ways:

- Docker or Docker Compose
- AWS Lambda
- Kubernetes
- Using Node.js directly

The easiest way to get started locally is to use Docker Compose.

Once you have chosen an approach, continue to the [configuration guide](./configuration.md).
