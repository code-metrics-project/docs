# Data sources

Code Metrics provides a number of data sources that you can use to explore your data. You can filter and group your data in a number of ways to get the insights you need.

## Available data sources

### [Source code metrics](./query_source_code.md)

Data about the structure, complexity and health of your codebase.

Metrics include:

- Test coverage
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Codebase size (ncloc)

### [Build and deployment pipelines](./query_pipelines.md)

Duration, success percentage and outcomes of build and deployment pipelines.

Metrics include:

- Pipeline outcomes (successful/failed/aborted)
- Pipeline success percentage
- Pipeline execution duration

### [Repository churn](./query_repo_churn.md)

A metric showing the amount of change in a repository.

### [Bug culprit files](./query_bug_culprits.md)

Identifies files that are frequently changed in response to bug fixes. These are potential 'culprits' for code that needs attention.

### [Bugs and escaped bugs](./query_bugs.md)

Bugs/defects from the ALM tool, such as Jira. Helpful to correlate against other software quality metrics.

### [DORA metrics](./dora.md)

Deployment frequency, change failure rate, time to restore service and lead time for changes.

### [Changes outside working pattern](./query_working_pattern.md)

A metric showing the number of changes (commits) made outside of a team's working hours or days.

### [Vulnerabilities](./query_vulnerabilities.md)

Number and severity of vulnerabilities for a repository.

### Pull Request (PR) metrics

Metrics about pull requests, such as:

- PR duration
- PR size

### [Change types](./query_change_types.md)

Types of changes that teams are making to the codebase.
