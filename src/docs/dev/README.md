# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the Code Metrics developer documentation! Whether you're new to the project or an existing contributor looking for a refresher, this is your guide to understanding how we work.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the project (or otherwise interested in how we do things), this documentation covers our development approach, coding standards, architectural patterns, and practices that help us maintain a high-quality codebase.

## Key Resources

Here are the key resources for contributors:

- [Standards and Patterns](./standards_patterns.md) - Our coding standards, architectural patterns, and development norms for both frontend and backend
- [Architecture](../architecture.md) - The system architecture and integration points
- [Mocks](../../mocks/README.md) - Information about the mock services for testing and development
- [Release Process](./release.md) - How we handle versioning, releases, and changelogs

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone! Before you start, please familiarise yourself with our standards and patterns to ensure your contributions align with our project's approach.

When making changes:

1. Follow our [coding standards](./standards_patterns.md) and [architectural patterns](../architecture.md)
