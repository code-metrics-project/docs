# Getting started

You can run CodeMetrics in a number of ways:

- [Docker or Docker Compose](./deployment_docker.md)
- [AWS Lambda](./deployment_lambda.md)
- [Kubernetes](./helm.md)
- [Using Node.js directly](./run_local_node.md)

Once you have chosen an approach, continue to the [configuration guide](./configuration.md).

See the [AWS Lambda deployment instructions](./deployment_lambda.md).

## Kubernetes

The CodeMetrics Docker containers can also be run on Kubernetes.

See the [instructions for using Helm](./helm.md).

## Using Node.js directly
